This week I'm celebrating completing my first year on the research 
tenure-track at Johns Hopkins! I can't say it has been a walk in 
the park --- _many hard lessons learned_ ---, but I can say I love 
what I get to do everyday and feel incredibly fortunate to work 
here with such great colleagues and students! 

So while reflecting on this past year, I have been thinking about 
many great blogposts I read containing information about how to enjoy 
being on the tenure-track and not stress out about it, including 
one of favorites, [The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/). I don't want reinvent the wheel,
but thought I would echo a bit of advice that I've 
learned this year in terms of time management and productivity. 

- Learn to polietly say no as much as humanly possible. Honestly, 
this is the thing I _still struggle the most with_, but I constantly 
remind myself everyday. Protect your time. It is much more 
valuable than you could ever imagine.

- Being productive does not mean needing to spend hours in the office 
or working on the weekends. Learn to proritize and outsource. 
You can absolutely have a wonderful work-life balance and crush
it as principal investigator (PI) with the right support team. 

- **If all else fails** and you feel like you are wasting time / spinning
your wheels on something that's confusing or unclear (e.g. the grants
process, effort reporting, all things related to your home 
department or institution, or just need to vent), --- _which 
happened to me many, many times the past year_ --- **follow 
the flow chart** given to me by one of my awesome faculty
mentors, [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com) and ask for help:

Hope everyone's year is off to a great start!
