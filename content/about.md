I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu), a Preceptor in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://www.jhu-bmb-phd.org/faculty/stephanie-hicks) PhD program, and a faculty member of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](http://jhudatascience.org). I'm also a co-host of the [The Corresponding Author](https://twitter.com/CorrespondAuth) podcast, member of the [Editorial Board for _Genome Biology_](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board), and co-founder of [R-Ladies Baltimore](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/). 

I received my B.S. in [Mathematics](https://www.math.lsu.edu) from [LSU](https://www.lsu.edu) and my M.A. and Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.rice.edu) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu) under the direction of [Marek Kimmel](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/marek-kimmel) and [Sharon Plon](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/sharon-plon-28865) ([@splon](https://twitter.com/splon)). 

I completed my postdoctoral training with [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu) ([@rafalab](https://twitter.com/rafalab)) in the [Department of Data Science](https://ds.dfci.harvard.edu/) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org) and [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics). This postdoctoral research resulted in a [K99/R00 grant](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-077.html) from the [National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)](https://www.genome.gov/) ([@genome_gov](https://twitter.com/genome_gov)) to develop [statistical methods for the normalization and quantification of single-cell RNA-sequencing data](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9243746&icde=32574421&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=) (R00HG009007). 

Currently, I co-lead as a Principal Investigator a R01 grant from the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) ([@NIMHgov](https://twitter.com/NIMHgov)) to develop improved statistical methods for the [integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/qPVsXfCAiEWzTUirO5-Ppg/project-details/10138028#similar-Projects) (R01MH13183). 

Most recently, I was selected for the [**Teaching in the Health Sciences Young Investigator Award**](https://community.amstat.org/tshs/awards/younginvestigatoraward) and the [**COPSS Leadership Academy**](https://community.amstat.org/copss/awards/leadership-academy) from the American Statistical Association (ASA), arguably the statistical professionâ€™s most prestigious award for early career leaders in Statistics and Data Science.
