For 2020, I am the Chair of the [Committee on Women in Statistics](https://community.amstat.org/cowis/home) (COWIS) from the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org) and [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://www.lucymcgowan.com) from Wake Forest University is the Vice-Chair. 
As a committee we meet quarterly to discuss goals that we set for ourselves and progress to date on those goals. One of our goals is to make better use of the [@WomenInStat](https://twitter.com/womeninstat) twitter handle, which is run by members of our committee. 

In our Q2 meeting in May 2020, Lucy had a wonderful suggestion of using the [@WomenInStat](https://twitter.com/womeninstat) twitter account to [uplift the voices](https://twitter.com/WomenInStat/status/1267521042735599617) of female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in Statistics and Data Science by hosting weekly a rotating curator (RoCur)! We will be using the hashtag [#WSDS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WSDS) to stand for Women in Statistics and Data Science, but we define this to be inclusive to female and minority genders with this hashtag.

The idea is borrowed from the wonderful [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) twitter account which also hosts RoCurs for the [@RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/rladiesglobal) community [#rladies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rladies). 

Lucy has done a fantastic job [getting everything set up](https://github.com/asacowis/rocur) and we are now ready to launch! 

### Objectives 

We have two main objectives with the RoCurs: 

1. To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the Women in Statistics and Data Science community.
2. To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in Statistics and Data Science.

### How it will work?

Every week, a different person takes over our twitter account to talk about the work they do in statistics and data science. 

Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences, from novice to expert. 

### Week 1 is dedicated to amplifying voices of Black scholars

To help make sure we've worked out all the kinks of getting this project launched, I offered to kick things off. Given complete tragedy we have watched unfold the last two weeks, I am dedicating my RoCur week to amplify voices of Black female scholars in Statistics and Data Science.
