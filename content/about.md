I am an applied statistician who develops [fast, scalable, statistical methodology](../projects/index.html), and [open-source software](../software/index.html) for biomedical data analysis, which often contains noisy or missing data and systematic biases. Specifically, my research addresses statistical and computational challenges in single-cell genomics, epigenomics, and spatial transcriptomics leading to an improved understanding of human health and disease. My research philosophy is [**problem-forward**](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/05/29/what-statistics-should-do-about-big-data-problem-forward-not-solution-backward/): I develop statistical methods and software that are motivated by concrete problems, often with real-world, messy data. This philosophy permeates into my contributions to [statistics and data science education](../teaching/index.html), and service to the profession. For example, I also develop [resources for data science education](https://www.opencasestudies.org) motivated by real-world problems and messy data and I serve my professional community at large, and being an advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion.

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu), a Preceptor in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://www.jhu-bmb-phd.org/faculty/stephanie-hicks) PhD program, and a faculty member of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](http://jhudatascience.org) and the [Center for Computational Biology](https://ccb.jhu.edu/people.php). I'm also a co-host of the [The Corresponding Author](https://twitter.com/CorrespondAuth) podcast, member of the [Editorial Board for _Genome Biology_](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board), an Associate Editor for [Reproducibility](https://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide/) at the [Journal of the American Statistical Association](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/uasa20/current), and co-founder of [R-Ladies Baltimore](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/). 



I received my B.S. in [Mathematics](https://www.math.lsu.edu) from [LSU](https://www.lsu.edu) and my M.A. and Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.rice.edu) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu) under the direction of [Marek Kimmel](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/marek-kimmel) and [Sharon Plon](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/sharon-plon-28865) ([@splon](https://twitter.com/splon)). 

I completed my postdoctoral training with [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu) ([@rafalab](https://twitter.com/rafalab)) in the [Department of Data Science](https://ds.dfci.harvard.edu/) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org) and [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics). This postdoctoral research resulted in a [K99/R00 grant](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-077.html) from the [National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)](https://www.genome.gov/) ([@genome_gov](https://twitter.com/genome_gov)) to develop [statistical methods for the normalization and quantification of single-cell RNA-sequencing data](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9243746&icde=32574421&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=) (R00HG009007). 

Currently, I co-lead as a Principal Investigator a R01 grant from the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) ([@NIMHgov](https://twitter.com/NIMHgov)) to develop improved statistical methods for the [integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/qPVsXfCAiEWzTUirO5-Ppg/project-details/10138028#similar-Projects) (R01MH13183). 

Most recently, I was selected for the [**Teaching in the Health Sciences Young Investigator Award**](https://community.amstat.org/tshs/awards/younginvestigatoraward) and the [**COPSS Leadership Academy**](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2021/05/01/2021-copss-award-winners/) from the American Statistical Association (ASA), arguably the statistical professionâ€™s most prestigious award for early career leaders in Statistics and Data Science.
