It's 2019 and I decided to revamp my website with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)! So far, 
I really like it! I fell in love with 
[Shannon Ellis](http://www.shanellis.com)'s template and 
humbly borrowed her template to create this website. 

For those that may follow my other blog [Statistical [R]ecipes](https://statisticalrecipes.blogspot.com), 
fear not! There are still plans to keep that updated with 
cooking recipes that we come across, but I plan to post my
scientific / academic related blogs here. 

Wishing everyone a Happy New Year!
