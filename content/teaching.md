# Books


### Genomics 

- [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis in Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/). Online book that teaches users how to make use of cutting-edge Bioconductor tools to process, analyze, visualize, and explore single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq) data. Online companion for a [manuscript published](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0654-x) in _Nature Methods_.
  - Authors: Robert Amezquita, Aaron Lun, Stephanie C. Hicks, Raphael Gottardo


### Data Science 

- [Tidyverse Skills for Data Science](https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/) [[Available on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/tidyverseskillsdatascience)]. Online book that teaches users a powerful set of R packages known as the Tidyverse to learn the different aspects of the data science pipeline, from importing the data, tidying the data into a format that is easy to work with, exploring and visualizing the data, and fitting machine learning models. Online companion for the [Tidyverse Skills for Data Science in R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tidyverse-data-science-r/) on Coursera.
