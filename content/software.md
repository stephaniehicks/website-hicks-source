## Bioconductor 

#### Software 

- [R/methylCC](http://bioconductor.org/packages/methylCC) <img src="https://bioconductor.org/shields/years-in-bioc/methylCC.svg">: R/Bioconductor package to estimate the cell composition of whole blood in DNA methylation samples in microarray or sequencing platforms. ([Hicks and Irizarry, 2019. _Genome Biology_](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1827-8))
- [R/mbkmeans](http://bioconductor.org/packages/mbkmeans) <img src="https://bioconductor.org/shields/years-in-bioc/mbkmeans.svg">: R/Bioconductor package implementing the mini-batch optimization for _k_-means clustering proposed in [Sculley (2010)](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dsculley/papers/fastkmeans.pdf) for large datasets, including single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The mini batch _k_-means algorithm can be run with data stored in memory or on disk (e.g. HDF5 file format).
- [R/qsmooth](http://bioconductor.org/packages/qsmooth) <img src="https://bioconductor.org/shields/years-in-bioc/qsmooth.svg">: R package available that implements a generalization of quantile normalization, referred to as smooth quantile normalization (**qsmooth**), which is based on the assumption that the statistical distribution of each sample should be the same (or have the same distributional shape) within biological groups or conditions. ([Hicks et al., 2018. _Biostatistics_](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx028))
- [R/quantro](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/quantro.html) <img src="https://bioconductor.org/shields/years-in-bioc/quantro.svg">: R package available on Bioconductor to test for global differences between groups of distributions to decide when to use quantile normalization. ([Hicks and Irizarry, 2015. _Genome Biology_](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0679-0))

#### Data packages

- [benchmarkfdrData2019](http://bioconductor.org/packages/benchmarkfdrData2019): Benchmarking results for experimental and simulated data sets used in Korthauer and Kimes et al. (2019) to compare methods for controlling the false discovery rate. A shiny app to interactively explore the data is available on the [benchmark-shiny repository](https://github.com/kdkorthauer/benchmarkfdr-shiny) on GitHub. 
- [bodymapRat](http://bioconductor.org/packages/bodymapRat): R data package that contains an SummarizedExperiment from the [Yu et al. (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510058) paper that performed the rat BodyMap across 11 organs and 4 developmental stage. 
- [TENxPBMCData](http://bioconductor.org/packages/TENxPBMCData): R data package that contains a set of SingleCellExperiment objects with single-cell RNA-sequencing data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells generated by 10X Genomics.
