I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu). I'm also a faculty member of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](http://jhudatascience.org) and co-founder of [R-Ladies Baltimore](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/). 

I received my B.S. in [Mathematics](https://www.math.lsu.edu) from [LSU](https://www.lsu.edu) and my M.A. and Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.rice.edu) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu) under the direction of [Marek Kimmel](https://statistics.rice.edu/people/marek-kimmel) and [Sharon Plon](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/sharon-plon-28865) ([@splon](https://twitter.com/splon)). 

I completed my postdoctoral training with [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu) ([@rafalab](https://twitter.com/rafalab)) in the [Department of Data Science](https://ds.dfci.harvard.edu/) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org) and [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics). This postdoctoral research resulted in a [K99/R00 grant](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-077.html) from the [National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)](https://www.genome.gov/) ([@genome_gov](https://twitter.com/genome_gov)) to develop [statistical methods for the normalization and quantification of single-cell RNA-Sequencing data](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9243746&icde=32574421&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=).
